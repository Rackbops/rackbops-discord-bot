// Shared client-IP resolution for the host's HTTP router (docs/adr/0007-host-owned-http-router.md
// decision 2's trust caveat; #319). `CF-Connecting-IP` is set by Cloudflare's edge for anything
// that genuinely transits its network, but nothing about a raw HTTP request proves it actually
// came that way -- a header is just text a caller supplies. ADR-0007 documented this exact gap
// itself ("nothing re-verifies it"). This module is that verification: the header is honored only
// from a peer address that resolves to the deployment's own Cloudflare Tunnel sidecar
// (`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOST`); everything else falls back to the real connection peer, so an untrusted
// caller can never claim a fresh identity per request. Copied from Rackbops/rackbops-bot-plugins#70
// (packages/net/clientIp.ts) rather than published as a package -- the two repos don't share one.
